# Blogstack: Static Website

An AWS CDK pattern / solution construct.

**This is experimental! Do not use in production**, I use it for my private blog.

Implements a static website, which will be deployed from a local directory to a bucket, that is provided behind a CloudFront CDN.

## Overview

The AWS infrastructure looks like that:

## Usage

**Note:** The NPM package is hosted on [Github packages](https://github.com/features/packages) as I do not consider it production ready and do not want to contribute to accidental installsâ€¦ Read up how to use Github Packages hosted NPM packages if you want to use it. Read up how to use [Github Packages hosted NPM packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages#installing-a-package) if you want to use it

In your stack:

```typescript
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import * as route53 from '@aws-cdk/aws-route53';
import { StaticWebsite } from '@ukautz/aws-cdk-blogstack-static-website';

export class YourStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.Stack) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // load or create a hosted zone
    const hostedZone = route53.HostedZone.fromLookup(this, 'id', {
      domainName: 'your-domain.tld',
    });

    // create all static website infra
    new StaticWebsite(this, 'StaticWebsite', {
      directory: '/path/to/where/your/contents/are',
      domain: 'blog.your-domain.tld',
      hostedZone,
    });
  }
}
```


## Notes

This is a very opinionated implementation:

- _Website Mode_: This module implements two behaviors that influence how website delivery from S3 is being done in regards to `index.html` files:
  - `websiteMode: false` (default): The S3 bucket is hidden and closed, that is: not accessible from anything but CloudFront. This can only be done if the S3 bucket website is _not _ configured as a [website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-websiteconfiguration.html). The consequence is: URLs _must_ point to files, _not_ folders. As in: `https://yourdomain.tld/blog/` will _not_ work, it must be `https://yourdomain.tld/blog/index.html` (or whichever HTML document contains the blog)
  - `websiteMode: true`: The S3 bucket is openly (read) accessible by everyone, including CloudFront and the bucket is configured as a [website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-websiteconfiguration.html), which means `index.html` is being used if the URL path points to a folder.
- _All (peer-)dependencies are pinned version_, as `@experimental` constructs are being used, interface changes in minor upgrades are expected. I run a [tooling](.github/workflows/aws-cdk-update.yml) once a week that runs all the tests and creates new releases, assuming AWS CDK has a new release

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
